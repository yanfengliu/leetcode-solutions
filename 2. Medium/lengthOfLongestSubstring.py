# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Examples:

# Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
# Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be
#   a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
